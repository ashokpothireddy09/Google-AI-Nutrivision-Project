# Requirements Docs Index

This folder contains requirement baselines split by concern.

## Files

- `business-requirements.md`
  - Business objective, scope, constraints, and submission expectations.
- `ux-demo-requirements.md`
  - UX behavior, demo moments, and interaction contract.
- `technical-baseline.md`
  - Technical stack, architecture baseline, and gap checklist.

## Notes

- These are requirement-level baselines, not daily status trackers.
- Daily progress should be tracked in `project_management/status.md` and `project_management/checklist.md`.
