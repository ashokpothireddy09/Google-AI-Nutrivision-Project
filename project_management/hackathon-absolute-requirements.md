# Gemini Live Agent Challenge - Absolute Requirements (Organized)

This file is the non-negotiable requirement summary for submission quality control.

## 1) Competition Window and Deadline

- Submission window opened: February 16, 2026.
- Submission deadline: March 16, 2026 at 5:00 PM PDT.
- Equivalent local reference used in this repo: March 17, 2026 at 01:00 CET.

## 2) Mandatory Technical Requirements

The project must satisfy all of the following:

1. Use a Gemini model.
2. Use Google GenAI SDK or ADK.
3. Use at least one Google Cloud service.
4. Run backend on Google Cloud (not local-only demo).

## 3) Challenge Track Fit

This project is aligned to the **Live Agent** track.

Live Agent expectation:

- Real-time multimodal interaction.
- Natural, interruption-tolerant conversation.
- Practical live use case (not static or scripted mock behavior).

## 4) Mandatory Submission Artifacts

All items below are required for a valid submission:

1. Public code repository.
2. Architecture diagram (clear component flow and cloud services).
3. Setup guide that is reproducible from clean environment.
4. Demo video under 4 minutes.
5. Visible cloud proof in demo (Cloud Run console and/or live URL).

## 5) Demo Video Rules

- Max duration: 4:00.
- Must show real-time behavior.
- Must not rely on mock-only flow.
- Must include proof that backend is running on Google Cloud.

## 6) Recommended Score Boosters (Optional)

- Publish blog/video about the project.
- Include deployment automation scripts (Terraform already present).

## 7) Project-Specific Completion Gate

Do not mark submission-ready unless all are true:

1. Cloud deployment is live and demonstrated.
2. Repo is public and complete.
3. Architecture diagram is in repo.
4. Setup guide is verified from clean machine.
5. Demo video passes time and cloud-proof checks.
