# Requirements Baseline Index (Read in Order)

These files define stable baseline requirements.

## Sequence

1. `01_business-requirements.md`
  - Business objective, challenge constraints, and scope boundaries.
2. `02_ux-demo-requirements.md`
  - UX behavior, demo moments, voice/HUD contract.
3. `03_technical-baseline.md`
  - Stack baseline, architecture constraints, and technical gaps.

## Notes

- Use `requirements_from_user.md` for latest locked decisions.
- Use `status.md` for current progress and pending work.
- For implementation planning, read all three files before editing code.
